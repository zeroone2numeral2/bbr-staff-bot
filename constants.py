- <code>/welcome</code>: see or edit a langauge's welcome text
- <code>/placeholders</code>: list available placeholders (they can be used in welcome texts)

<b><u>Admin commands (staff chat)</u></b>:
- <code>/setstaff</code>: use the current chat as staff chat
- <code>/reloadadmins</code>: update the staff chat's admins list

The following commands work in reply to an user's forwarded message in the staff chat:
- <code>/ban [reason]</code>: ban an user from using the bot. The bot will tell the user that they are banned 
when they send new messages. The reason is optional
- <code>/shadowban [reason]</code>: like <code>/ban</code>, but the user won't know they were banned
- <code>/unban</code>: unban the user
- <code>/info</code>: show everything we know about that user

<b><u>Things to keep in mind</u></b>
- an admin is whoever is an administrator in the current staff chat. Admins are updated as soon as they are added/removed, \
but <code>/reloadadmins</code> can be used to force-refresh the admins list
- <i>anyone</i> in the staff chat is allowed to reply to users or ban them
