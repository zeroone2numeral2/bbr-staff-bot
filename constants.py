‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Only the staff chat's administrators are allowed to use these commands
‚Ä¢ /texts: see or edit all messages that should depend on the user's language (that is: the welcome message, \
the \"sent to staff\" message)
‚Ä¢ /settings: list all available settings
‚Ä¢ /set <code>[setting] [new value]</code>: change a setting
‚Ä¢ /placeholders: list available placeholders (they can be used in welcome texts)

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ <b><u>Staff chat commands</u></b>:
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Anyone in the staff chat is allowed to use these commands or perform these actions
‚Ä¢ <code>/reloadadmins</code>: update the staff chat's admins list
‚Ä¢ <code>/revoke</code> or <code>/del</code> (in reply to an admin message): delete an admin's reply from the user's private chat
‚Ä¢ <code>++[reply]</code>: you can reply to an admin's message that was previously sent to the user by answering it with \
"<code>++</code>". The text after "<code>++</code>" will be sent to the user <b>in reply</b> to the admin message they \
previously received

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ The following commands work in reply to an user's forwarded message in the staff chat:
‚Ä¢ <code>/ban [reason]</code>: ban an user from using the bot. The bot will tell the user that they are banned \
when they send new messages. The reason is optional
‚Ä¢ <code>/shadowban [reason]</code>: like <code>/ban</code>, but the user won't know they were banned
‚Ä¢ <code>/unban</code>: unban the user
‚Ä¢ <code>/info</code>: show everything we know about that user

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ <b><u>Other</u></b>:
